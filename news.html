        <h4 class="intro">
          Exercising regularly — every day if possible — is the single most
          important thing you can do for your health. In the short term,
          exercise helps to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. In
          the long term, it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes,
          dementia, depression, and many cancers.

        <h3 class="newsh3">What are the best types of exercise?</h3>
        <p class="articleText">
          While there are endless forms of exercise, experts categorize physical
          activity into four broad types based on what each calls upon your body
          to do and how the movement benefits you. Aerobic exercise is marked by
          an increased heart rate. Although most aerobic exercises require you
          to move your whole body, the main focus is on your heart and lungs
          (aerobic exercise is often called "cardio" because it challenges and
          benefits your cardiovascular system). Activities like walking,
          swimming, dancing, and cycling, if done at sufficient intensity, get
          you breathing faster and your heart working harder. Aerobic exercises
          burn fat, improve your mood, reduce inflammation, and lower blood
          sugar. Strength training, sometimes called resistance training, should
          be performed two to three times a week. Squats, lunges, push-ups, and
          the exercises performed on resistance machines or using weights or
          bands help maintain and even build muscle mass and strength. Strength
          training also helps prevent falls, keep bones strong, lower blood
          sugar levels, and improve balance. Do a combination of both isometric
          and isotonic exercises. Isometric exercises, such as doing planks and
          holding leg lifts, are done without movement. They are great for
          maintaining strength and improving stability. Isotonic exercises
          require you to bear weight throughout a range of motion. Bicep curls,
          bench presses, and sit-ups are all forms of isotonic exercise.
          Stretching exercises keep your muscles and tendons flexible, preserve
          your posture, and improve mobility, especially as you age. Stretching
          can be done every day. Balance exercises call on the various systems
          that help you stay upright and oriented, such as those of the inner
          ear, vision, and muscles and joints. Tai chi and yoga are great forms
          of balance exercises that can help you avoid falls and stay
          independent well into your senior years.

        <h3 class="newsh3">How much exercise do I need?</h3>
        <p class="articleText">
          How much exercise you should be getting depends on several factors,
          including your current level of fitness, your fitness goals, the types
          of exercise you're planning to do, and whether you have deficits in
          such areas as strength, flexibility, or balance. As a general rule,
          150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity (or 75 minutes of
          vigorous exercise) is recommended as a weekly minimum. As you become
          more fit, you'll want to exceed that in order to reap maximum benefit.
          A natural way of splitting up the 150 minutes might be to do a
          30-minute session five times per week, or you can break it up and do
          two 15-minute sessions during a single day. Adopt whatever schedule
          fits your lifestyle. For strength exercises, aim to work all your
          major muscle groups twice to three times each week, leaving 48 hours
          between each workout for recovery. If you do total-body workouts,
          that's two sessions per week. If you choose to split your workouts to
          target a specific muscle group (for example, "leg day"), that will
          require more frequent workouts. Just make sure you're leaving 48 hours
          of rest before you rework a major muscle. If you have noticed problems
          with your balance such as unsteadiness, dizziness, or vertigo, talk to
          a health care provider for recommendations about balance-specific
          exercises. Get in three half-hour workouts each week in addition to a
          30-minute walk at least twice weekly. It's best to stretch after you
          have warmed up for a few minutes, or perform stretching exercises
          after you completed your workout. When stretching each muscle group,
          take it slow and steady, release, repeat again. But how much exercise
          is too much? You should expect a little muscle soreness after
          workouts, especially in the beginning. But if you find that your body
          is simply not recovering between workouts, you may be overtraining.
          Remember that seniors need more recovery time than younger people.
          With the exception of "welcome" muscle soreness, an exercise program
          should make you feel good. If it doesn't, you're probably overdoing
          it. That doesn't mean you should quit, only that you should dial back
          the intensity or frequency of your workouts until you hit the sweet
          spot in which you've tired out your body but then recovered enough to
          tackle your next session with enthusiasm.

        <h3 class="newsh3">What are the benefits of exercise?</h3>
        <p class="articleText">
          A smartly designed exercise program will benefit your body and mind in
          innumerable ways. The benefits of exercise on mental health are well
          documented. For example, one major study found that sedentary people
          are 44% more likely to be depressed. Another found that those with
          mild to moderate depression could get similar results to those
          obtained through antidepressants just by exercising for 90 minutes
          each week. The key appears to be the release of brain chemicals such
          as serotonin and dopamine, which help lift mood and combat stress.
          We're all familiar with exercise's ability to improve cardiovascular
          health. But how does exercise lower blood pressure? Interestingly,
          when you stimulate your circulatory system through aerobic exercise,
          you're temporarily increasing your blood pressure by forcing the
          system to work harder, but when you've finished exercising, your blood
          pressure drops to a lower level than it was before you began. Many
          people think of exercise as an integral part of weight loss, and
          although diet is also extremely important, they're not wrong. But what
          exercise burns the most calories? Generally, aerobic exercises
          (cardio) are great for expending calories and reducing fat. But don't
          overlook the effectiveness of strength training, which optimizes your
          body's ratio of lean muscle to fat (It's also the best exercise for
          bone strength). There's no Holy Grail when it comes to a single best
          weight-loss exercise. The best exercise to lose weight is the one
          you'll do consistently. Whatever gets your heart rate up and gets your
          body moving — while having fun and staying motivated — is the exercise
          that will help you shed pounds.
